# match-3
Match-3 game prototype

This is currently little more than experimental code from almost a year ago that I abandoned due to my limited programming skills with gdscript.

Converted to the Godot 3 API now because I looked over the code again, and determined I could probably make this work now. Besides, I need a sideproject. LetÂ´s see:)

What "works" right now:

- draws a 8x12 grid of tokens, which type is determined by a randomized array.
- tokens are draggable, though right now they can be dragged anywhere

to be continued this weekend
